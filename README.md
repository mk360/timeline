## Timeline Library

This is a timeline that can display chronogically-connected events, in one or many unconnected areas (ex. the effects of the 2008 crisis on each continent of the world).

### Features
- A simple API: setting the timeline up requires a few lines, and every needed element has a default component that is already provided.

- Premade components: this Timeline plugin features a default SVG renderer and three calendars to get you started.

- Highly customizable calendars: create your own calendar, provide your own odd days, numbers of weeks, months, or any time units you desire!

- Multiple concurrent timelines: where a regular library can only track a single timeline, this library allows you to track many ones at the same time! See how events unfolded across multiple areas in the world, even the ones that aren't related.

- Get a precise idea of eras, epochs and time periods in which your events happen!

- Highly customizable output: the dimensions of the SVG, the size of the content, the viewbox, the calendar, the events, the number of trackable periods.
